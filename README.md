This is a homework about "Parking Corncol System"
Maybe it is simple, but I spent a lot of time to fininsh it.
Some place may have some bugs, if you want to make it perfect, you need to debug
However, I try my best to make it useful and easy to read
Every part of this program can run successfully 
Thanks for reading this!
